# üîç File-Monitoring-System

## üéØ Objective
This project aims to simulate monitoring a file directory for cases of added files, deleted files, and modified files. The primary focus was to implement a Python-based solution that utilizes hashing (SHA-256) for file integrity checks, logging to track changes in real-time, and signal handling for graceful termination. The system periodically scans a specified directory, detects changes efficiently, and logs them with timestamps for future reference, showcasing skills in automation, scripting, and error handling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Run Code
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bmach1062/File-Monitoring-System.git
2. **Navigate to the IDS Directory**  
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd File-Monitoring-System/IDS
3. **Run the Program**  
   Start monitoring the files from "monitored":
   ```bash
   python3 ids.py

![program start](https://github.com/bmach1062/File-Monitoring-System/blob/4477bc4ade034980aeeeb0368c0c2be60abb368c/program_start.png)

* Please note that if you do not see changes to file_changes.log, you should either do ctrl+s to save MODIFIED changes or click on any other file and then click on the file_changes.log file again.
## ‚ûï Added Files Scenario
- When you add a new file to the "monitored" directory, file_changes.log (under "logs" directory) will update and present a message about the newly added file.

## üóë Deleted Files Scenario
- When you delete a file in the "monitored" directory, file_changes.log (under "logs" directory) will update and present a message about the deleted file.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Modified Files Scenario
- When you modify a file in the "monitored" directory, file_changes.log(under "logs" directory) will update and present a message about the modified file. In this example, we modified file1.txt and get notified about the modification.

## ‚ùå Terminating Program Scenario
- If you want to terminate the program, simply do "Ctrl+C" to gracefully exit.

## üîß Next Steps
While the project successfully monitors file changes and logs modifications, there are a few areas for improvement:
1. **Real-Time Log Updates**<br>
   Currently, if the log file is open, notifications for file deletions do not appear immediately unless the log file tab is closed and reopened or switched back and forth. A future update will ensure real-time log updates without requiring manual refreshes.
2. **Recursive Directory Monitoring**<br>
  At the moment, the script only tracks files in the top-level monitored/ directory. A future enhancement will allow the program to monitor subdirectories as well, ensuring complete file tracking.
3. **Real-Time Notifications**<br>
  Instead of relying solely on log files, the program could display real-time alerts using:
        <ol>
          <li>Desktop notifications when a file is added, modified, or deleted.</li>
          <li>Email alerts for critical file changes.</li>
        </ol>

## üéØ Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates my ability to develop an automated Python-based file monitoring system that leverages SHA-256 hashing for file integrity, structured logging for real-time change tracking, and robust error handling for seamless operation. By building this system, I have showcased my skills in automation, security awareness, and efficient resource management, essential for a cybersecurity role.
