# File-Monitoring-System

## Objective
This project aims to simulate monitoring a file directory for cases of added files, deleted files, and modified files. The primary focus was to implement a Python-based solution that utilizes hashing (SHA-256) for file integrity checks, logging to track changes in real-time, and signal handling for graceful termination. The system periodically scans a specified directory, detects changes efficiently, and logs them with timestamps for future reference, showcasing skills in automation, scripting, and error handling.
